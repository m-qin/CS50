    <p>ShuangLugha is a website that allows users - primarily kids - who speak English to learn Chinese and/or Swahili!</p>
    <p>Users can access six fun, introductory lessons on YouTube, with topics ranging from greetings to colors to food.
    They can practice what they've learned with flashcards on the "Practice" tab, or quiz themselves on their progress
    through the "Quizzes" tab. Users may also track their progress, erase their quiz history, and/or change their password.
    If learning both Chinese and Swahili, users should make a separate account for each language.</p>

    <p>ShuangLugha was created by Asteria Chilambo and Michelle Qin, who are taking CS50 in their first semester at Harvard College.
    They both love languages (in addition to movies and traveling :), so the idea of ShuangLugha came to them naturally.
    Shuang (Âèå) is a Chinese word meaning "double", and Lugha is a Swahili word meaning "language", so ShuangLugha is a hybrid
    word meaning "double language" or, loosely, "bilingual". We want our website's users to become bi- (or tri-) lingual!</p>
